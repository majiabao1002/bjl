# Blackjack

Blackjack is a popular poker game. 10, J, Q, K points are all treated as 10 points, Ace(A) is used as 1 or 11 points, and 2 to 9 are the original denomination points. In the beginning, each player is given two cards, and the player can see one of the dealer's cards. Afterwards, he can decide whether to close the card according to his own number of points and the dealer’s already opened card. The value of the card is to obtain a point that is closer to 21 points and does not exceed 21 points. The greater the number of points, the less than 21 points are the winners. In addition, "Black Jack" (the first two cards with a face value of 21 points) is larger than a card with a total of 21 points.
